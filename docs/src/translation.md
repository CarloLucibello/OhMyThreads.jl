# Translation Guide

This page tries to give a general overview of how to translate patterns written with the built-in tools of [Base.Threads](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/multi-threading/) using the [OhMyThreads.jl API](@ref API).

Note that this should be seen as a rough guide and (intentionally) isn't supposed to replace a systematic introduction into the [OhMyThreads.jl API](@ref API).

## Basics

### `@threads`

```julia
# Base.Threads
@threads for i in 1:10
    println(i)
end
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads
tforeach(1:10) do i
    println(i)
end
```

#### `:static` scheduling

```julia
# Base.Threads
@threads :static for i in 1:10
    println(i)
end
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads
tforeach(1:10; schedule=:static) do i
    println(i)
end
```

### `@spawn`

```julia
# Base.Threads
@sync for i in 1:10
    @spawn println(i)
end
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads
tforeach(1:10; nchunks=10) do i
    println(i)
end
```

## Reduction

No built-in feature in Base.Threads.

```julia
# Base.Threads: basic manual implementation
data = rand(10)
chunks_itr = Iterators.partition(data, length(data) รท nthreads())
tasks = map(chunks_itr) do chunk
    @spawn reduce(+, chunk)
end
reduce(+, fetch.(tasks))
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads
data = rand(10)
treduce(+, data)
```

## Mutation

TODO: Remark why one has to be careful here (e.g. false sharing).

```julia
# Base.Threads
data = rand(10)
@threads for i in 1:10
    data[i] = calc(i)
end
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads: Variant 1
data = rand(10)
tforeach(data) do i
    data[i] = calc(i)
end
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads: Variant 2
data = rand(10)
tmap!(data, data) do i # TODO: comment on aliasing
    calc(i)
end
```

## Parallel initialization

```julia
# Base.Threads
data = Vector{Float64}(undef, 10)
@threads for i in 1:10
    data[i] = calc(i)
end
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads: Variant 1
data = tmap(i->calc(i), 1:10)
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads: Variant 2
data = tcollect(calc(i) for i in 1:10)
```
